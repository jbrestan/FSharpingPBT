Slides and examples from my Property-Based Testing talk at [FSharping](https://www.fsharping.cz/).

You can [view the slides](http://jbrestan.github.io/FSharpingPBT/) online, and browse the examples here in this repository in the `examples` folder, roughly showing the refactoring steps we made during the talk.

The deck was built using https://github.com/fsprojects/FsReveal
